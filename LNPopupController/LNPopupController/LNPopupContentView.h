It is shared for interactively opening the popup by panning the popup bar (when it is closed), or interactively closing the popup interactively by panning the popup content view (when the popup is open). If you disable the gesture recognizer after opening the popup, you must monitor the state of the popup and reenable the gesture recognizer once closed by the user or through code.
